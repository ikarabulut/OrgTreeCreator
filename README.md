# OrgTreeCreator
This is a Org Tree creator console application that was built using Dotnet core. The purpose of this project was to get algorithm practice. Specifically Trees.
***
### Techniques applied
- Build classes that can be used to build linked data structures such as trees and networks
- Recursion
- Searching and traversing trees
- Adding and removing values from sorted binary trees

### Best Practices followed
- TDD (See `/test/OrgTreeCreatorTests` for unit tests)
- Git tagging and hooks for formatting and test execution prior to commit


### Current State
- Class that can create a Binary tree with its `ToString()` method returning the tree of the selected node.
- Class that can create a Nary tree with its `ToString()` method returning the tree of the selected node.
